# Instructions
# implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.
# Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

#     x is an integer
#     y is +, -, *, or /
#     z is an integer

# For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

# Note that, just as python itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your interpreter.py be an interpreter for math!

    return a + b

def subtraction(a, b):

def divide(a, b):
    return a / b if b != 0 else print("Error, not divisible by 0")

def mutiply(a, b):
    return a * b
